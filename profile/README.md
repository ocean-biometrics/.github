## Ocean Intelligence for Nature-Based Finance

We transform complex biological data into insights for conservation and blue finance.

Ocean Biometrics specializes in turning ocean intelligence into actionable insights that power conservation efforts and advance blue nature finance mechanisms. We build AI and genomic-driven infrastructure by integrating multiple data streams, including meta-omics samples, environmental parameters, and geographical context, through advanced bioinformatics and systems biology workflows to deliver strategic outputs to drive both blue biotechnology innovation and conservation outcomes.

Our assessments reveal ecosystem vulnerability and resilience, while also identifying promising natural products and marine genetic resources with potential for bioinnovation, licensing, and sovereign asset valuation. The resulting ecosystem health indices and verified insights enable performance-based finance mechanisms—such as blue bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, and biodiversity-linked credits—through equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms, providing marine protected areas, investors, and coastal nations with a robust, science-based foundation for sustainable growth.

## Core Expertise Areas

-   **Genome-Resolved Analytics**: Our metagenomic workflow converts raw environmental DNA into high-quality microbial genomes, biosynthetic gene cluster maps, and AI-ranked enzyme candidates—capturing conservation value, metabolic capabilities, and commercial potential.
-   **Knowledge-Graph Intelligence**: A marine biodiversity knowledge graph (KG) integrates genetic, geospatial, biochemical, and environmental data to reveal hidden ecological linkages. This interconnected framework provides an auditable foundation for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) and equitable benefit-sharing.
-   **Ecological/Metabolic Networks & Time-Series Analyses**: Ecological and metabolic network analyses, along with time-series modeling, form a foundational pillar of our approach. Drawing on genomic (microbes) and amplicon (macrofauna) data, this pillar supports taxonomic and functional diversity analyses and food-web reconstructions.

## Our Repositories

This GitHub organization hosts the open-source projects and tools developed by Ocean BioMetrics. Our work is focused on providing the necessary infrastructure to connect ocean conservation with blue finance.
